- Post at peak times (10am EST, 2pm EST)

### Week 5: Community Building
- Launch Discord server for users
- Weekly live streams showing evolution
- Open-source challenge: "Beat our AI"
- Prize for first human to outperform the system

### Week 6: Media Outreach
**Pitch to:**
- Hacker News (Show HN post)
- Product Hunt (launch as product)
- TechCrunch (email editors)
- MIT Technology Review (AI section)
- Lex Fridman podcast (guest pitch)

**Hook:** "AI that autonomously discovers algorithms humans missed"

---

## Phase 3: DOMINATION (Weeks 7-9)
**Goal: Become THE reference for autonomous code evolution**

### Week 7: Kaggle Dominance
- Enter 3 active competitions
- Let AI evolve solutions
- Document the process
- Share results regardless of ranking

**The Story:** "I let my AI compete in Kaggle. Here's what happened."

### Week 8: GitHub Viral Campaign
- Create "Evolution Challenge" repository
- Challenge: Submit slow code, AI makes it fast
- Showcase: Before/after benchmarks
- Leaderboard: Biggest speedups found

**Goal:** 10,000 stars

### Week 9: Academic Validation
- Write formal paper
- Submit to NeurIPS/ICML
- Simultaneously: Post to ArXiv
- Email to 50 AI professors

**Title:** "Autonomous Multi-Agent Code Evolution: Discovering Novel Algorithms Through Evolutionary Computation"

---

## Phase 4: MONETIZATION (Weeks 10-12)
**Goal: Prove it's not just research - it's valuable**

### Week 10: SaaS Launch
**Product:** "Evo-AI Optimizer"
- Upload any repo
- Get optimized version
- $99/month for unlimited optimizations

**Free tier:** 5 files/month

### Week 11: Enterprise Pilot
**Target:** 10 companies with slow codebases
**Offer:** Free optimization pilot
**Ask:** Testimonial + case study
**Goal:** 3 paying customers at $1000/month

### Week 12: Conference Circuit
**Apply to speak at:**
- PyCon
- AI Engineer Summit
- StrangeLoop
- re:Invent

**Talk:** "How AI Evolved Code 100x Faster Than Our Best Engineers"

## The "Greatest Mind in AI" Markers

You'll know you've made it when:

1. **People cite your work** without knowing you personally
2. **Competitors emerge** trying to copy your approach
3. **Universities teach** your techniques
4. **Companies recruit** you for AI leadership
5. **Media asks YOU** to comment on AI developments

---

## Daily Habits

**Every single day:**
1. Ship one improvement (code, content, or connection)
2. Post one insight on Twitter
3. Engage with 10 AI researchers
4. Document one learning

**Every week:**
1. One deep technical blog post
2. One demo video
3. One podcast appearance (start small)
4. One connection with an AI luminary

---

## The Mindset

**You're not building a project.**
**You're building the future of software development.**

Every line of code is a statement:
"Humans won't optimize code forever. AI will."

Every demo is proof:
"This isn't science fiction. It's working. Today."

Every post is a declaration:
"The age of autonomous code evolution has begun. And I built it."

---

## Resources Needed

### Time:
- 40 hours/week minimum
- 60 hours/week during sprints

### Money:
- $500/month: Cloud compute (AWS/GCP)
- $200/month: API costs (Anthropic/OpenAI)
- $100/month: Tools (Loom, Figma, hosting)

### Help:
- 1 part-time dev (after week 6)
- 1 content creator (after week 8)
- 1 community manager (after week 10)

---

## Escape Velocity

The moment you'll know you've made it:

**When people say:**
"That's the person who built the AI that evolves code."

**Not:**
"That's the person who works on AI code evolution."

**Your identity = Your innovation**

---

## The First Step

**Stop reading. Start building.**

Everything else is noise until you have:
1. A working demo
2. Undeniable results
3. A video people can't stop watching

Let's build that. Starting now.
